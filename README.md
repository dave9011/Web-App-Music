# Web-App-Music
I wrote this music player app to practice more my JS skills, as well as experiment with some SVG animations. Locally it includes music from one of my favorite artists, Kanye West, but because of copyright issues I cannot post that on here. I am currently in the process of finding a new artist who can provide royalty-free tracks to feature.

Feel free to take a look! At the moment I can't put my Kanye tracks on here so I'm looking for some new music to substitute it.
